## How to Test All Features

### 1. Authentication Testing
```bash
# Start the application
npm run dev

# Test endpoints:
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend: http://localhost:3000/api
```

### 2. User Registration & Login
1. Visit `/signup` to create account
2. Visit `/signin` to login
3. Check role-based dashboard access

### 3. Admin Features (Requires Admin User)
1. Create admin user in MongoDB Atlas
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Test CRUD operations:
   - Contact management at `/admin/contacts`
   - Project management at `/admin/projects`

### 4. API Testing
Use tools like Postman to test:
- `POST /auth/signin`
- `GET /auth/signout`
- `GET /api/contacts` (protected)
- `POST /api/contacts`
- `PUT/DELETE /api/contacts/:id` (admin only)
